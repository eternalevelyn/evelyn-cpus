# evelyn-cpus
Pure-Rust implementation of a core-toggler. uses eframe &amp; sysinfo.

That being said. I originally got the idea from [cpu-controller](https://github.com/ART3MISTICAL/cpu-controller/), because I wanted to implement it a bit more efficiently, with a less power-intensive language and setup. And I achieved exactly that!
